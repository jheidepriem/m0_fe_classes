# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I got stuck several times and had to start over today. I'm feeling much better and once
again I was making something way more complicated than it needed to be.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Workflow has been good. I definitely need to take more breaks, because I can see how quickly work can become unproductive if I don't.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need my kids to be in school and my house to be quiet so I can focus. I ordered new headphones and a new monitor and I'm changing my workspace.
