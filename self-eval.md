# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I had a hard time with the last challenge. I wasn't able to figure part of it out. I did try to google but it's just not making sense to me. I reached out to a few of my classmates to see if they could help explain that section to me.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Workflow has been good. I definitely need to take more breaks, because I can see how quickly work can become unproductive if I don't.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need my kids to be in school and my house to be quiet so I can focus. I ordered new headphones and a new monitor and I'm changing my workspace.
